__*Gameplay objective:*__ Red and Yellow Discs are inserted from the top in alternating turns. Get 4 discs in a row, column or diagonal to win.

__*Technologies Used:*__ HTML, CSS and Javascript.

__*Approach Taken:*__ 
1. Started off with the basic HTML elements and the related CSS styling.
1. Basic gameplay javascript was then created (functions such as turn based gameplay and changing of element styling via DOM).
1. Further work on the gameplay logic was done, to allow for discs to drop to the lowest empty point, as well as highlighting function for indication of proposed disc placement.
1. Subsequently, winning condition checking function was implemented, allowing for full multiplayer gameplay, with winning text shown.
1. Lastly, basic single player functionality was added, with the cpu function performing semi-random actions on non-player turns.

__*Installation Instructions:*__ Open game link in browser.

__*Unsolved Problems:*__
* Single player mode CPU player is somewhat too easy, logic for it to make more informed decisions and better counter maneuvers are still a work in progress

__*Possible Evolution / Variation of Game:*__
* Introduce more game modes such as 5-In-A-Row, Power Up etc
* Have custom disc images or change the design theme of the game (Eg using logos from popular franchises as disc images)
